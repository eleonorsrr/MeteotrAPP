# MeteotrAPP: A Weather-Based Chord Progression Generator

## What is MeteotrAPP?

MeteotrAPP is a web app designed to inspire musicians and music lovers by generating chord progressions based on real-time weather conditions. 'Meteo' and 'trap' represent the union of two functionalities: one linked to the weather conditions and the other symbolizing a space where new ideas can be 'captured' and developed in an original way, reflecting a fresh and creative approach. 'Trap' (not the musical genre) evokes the idea of a dynamic and innovative environment where music and weather merge in surprising ways, symbolizing a unique fusion of elements you wouldn‚Äôt normally expect together.
By categorizing atmospheric conditions into four main types ‚ÄîSunny, Rainy, Cloudy, and Snowy‚Äî the app assigns a unique harmonic character to each, allowing users to explore different moods and textures in their music.

Each weather condition is associated with a specific chord scale:
- ‚òÄÔ∏è **Sunny** ‚Üí Major Chords (bright, uplifting harmonies)  
- üåßÔ∏è **Rainy** ‚Üí Minor Chords (moody, emotional progressions)  
- ‚òÅÔ∏è **Cloudy** ‚Üí Suspended 4th Chords & colorful variations (floating, unresolved tension)  
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Snowy** ‚Üí Major 7th Chords (soft, dreamy atmospheres)  

The app suggests chords tailored to the detected weather and lets users experiment with various musical parameters, including:
- üéµ **Chord Selection & Playback:** Choose from suggested chords and loop them to build progressions.  
- üéöÔ∏è **BPM & Time Signature Control:** Adjust the tempo and rhythmic feel of your loops.  
- üîÄ **Customizable Chord Order:** Arrange and reorder the selected chords to create unique sequences.  
- ‚ú® **Weather-Specific Effects:** Each condition comes with dedicated audio effects that enhance the overall sound.  

Whether you're looking for inspiration, experimenting with harmonies, or simply having fun with music creation, MeteotrAPP provides a unique way to blend meteorology and sound design. Let the weather shape your next musical idea!

## üéõÔ∏è App features: Interface Overview
By opening the app, a quick tutorial of the main features of the app will be displayed. This will allow the user to have a more functional and coherent flow in the creative experience, through a step by step mini guide.
The interface is divided in sections, explained below.

### üîù Top Panel
The top panel contains essential controls for managing playback and tempo settings:

- üü° **Play Button:** Starts looping the selected chords.  
- üî¥ **Stop Button:** Stops playback without clearing the current selection.  
- üü£ **Reset Button:** Clears the current selection, allowing a new one to be created.  
- ‚è±Ô∏è **BPM Selector:** Adjusts the beats per minute (default: 120 BPM). Changes can only be made while the loop is paused.  
- üéµ **Time Signature Selector:** Allows switching between **4/4, 3/4, 6/8, 2/4, 5/4, 7/4** (default: 4/4).

### üå¶Ô∏è Central Panel
The central panel provides manual control over the weather-based sound selection:

- **Scale Dropdowns:** Select a root note from one of the four dropdown containers to select the corrisponding weather condition: it changes the background and displays the corresponding chords for that scale below in the same central panel.
- **Weather Buttons:** By clicking on the desidered weather button, a characteristic sound can be activated (it will highlight the button with a blue border). Pressing an active button again stops the sound, pressing another button stop the previous sound and activate the new one.
- **Chord buttons:** The chords associated with the scale, suggested or chosen, will be displayed in the buttons below the dropdowns. By holding down the button, the notes played are shown.

## üéµ Usage modes: two creative experiences

MeteotrAPP offers two distinct modes for generating chord progressions:

### üåç Automatic Mode
In this mode, users can immediately search for a city using the search bar or flying around the world and clicking on the perfect city to get inspired. Once a city is selected, the app fetches real-time weather data using the **OpenWeather API**. The detected weather condition will:

- Highlight the corresponding **weather button**.  
- Change the background to reflect the weather.  
- Generate a **random scale** based on the scale type associated with it.  

For example, if the searched city has a **clear sky**, the chords from the **Major Scale** (e.g., D Major) will be suggested.

### üéÆ Play Mode
This mode allows users to manually select a weather condition without relying on city-based weather data.

- Select a condition choosing from one of the 4 **weather buttons** (to activate the characteristic sound, or go directly to the root note selection).
- Choose one of the **7 available root notes** for that condition.  
- The chords of the selected scale will appear.  

For example, if the user selects **Rainy** and then chooses **E** from the dropdown, the app will display **chords from the E Minor Scale**.
